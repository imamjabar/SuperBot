// Why every routine waits now (routine-holds.ts), on a Cloud home, read from three places: whether any AI of the owner's
// own can still run here (cloud-credit-moves.ts `away`, read with the engines), whether the owner removed every connected
// app and MCP server (marked when the last one goes, cleared when one comes back), and whether the plan was cancelled (the
// Admin's signed request, routes/cloud-signed.ts). What was last read is kept in routine-holds.json, so a restart neither
// frees nor pauses anything before the engines are read again. A cause that begins and pauses routines writes one quiet
// line in the owner's Chief's chat; nothing else is sent, so nobody who left is messaged.
